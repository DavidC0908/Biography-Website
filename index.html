    <p id="left">Hello, my name is David Cabrera and I was born on the 23rd of September in 2005. I spent the earlier
      years of my childhood growing up in the Dominican Republic before my family moved to New York City around the time
      I was in the third grade. Assimilating to a new environmennt and culture proved to be a very hard challenge to me as I had to learn an entire new language and meet new people from other bakground and cultures I had never interacted with up to that point. That period of my life was difficult but I think I came out of it alright.</p>

    <p id="right">Now in the present I currently attend Information Technology High School and I am currently a senior. Throughout my time in this school I have learned a lot of skills that have helped me to be sucessful at this school. The workload was a significant increase from middle school so I had to actually start studying and managing my time so my grades don't flop. I also learned skills in web development and design through the Web Design academy that I joined. And I was also lucky enough to be placed in the band which has been my favorite class by far since I already enjoyed it when I previously took it in middle school. My next step is going to college so hopefully the skills learned here make my college experience just a little easier. </p>

  <p id="hobby-text">I know this may not be seen as a hobby anymore since it's gotten so popular but videogames have always had an important place in my life. Some of my happiest and most fun moments have come with playing videogames with others or just by myself. Whether it's hitting an insane clutch in Valorant or experiencing an unforgetable narrative through God of War, videogames have had a great influence in my life even though I don't play as often as I used to.</p>

  <p id="music-text">I've been playing musical instruments since middle school and they are pretty fun. Up until this year I played the Tenor saxophone for the band at ITHS and I've had some of the most fun moments in school come from this class. Practicing new songs and playing them at concerts were always scary but the payoff was huge and both teachers that I've had have been nothing short of amazing. Today I no longer play the Tenor and have instead swapped to playing the Trombone since the band was lacking brass players.</p>
